"""
Shared HTTP client utilities for making requests to external services, including functions for handling authentication, error handling, and response parsing. This module provides a common interface for making HTTP requests to services like Keycloak for user provisioning and token validation, abstracting away the details of the HTTP interactions and allowing for easier integration with different authentication providers.
